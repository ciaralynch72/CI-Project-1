## UX 
#### Strategy

This site will be used to increase awareness of a new farmers' market to the broader locality and visitors to the area to help boost the local economy and local suppliers and vendors.

Target Users:

1. Those living or visiting the locality of Kilworth
2. Vendors and producers who are living in the community or within driving distance
4. People who wish to support the local economy
5. People who are interested in contributing to making the locality more substainable

What the users are looking for:

1. Information about when and where the farmers market is on
2. To be able find out more information by signing up to join the community
3. To be able to see what vendors will be in attendance

#### Scope
In order to achieve the strategy for both business and user goals I have included the following features:

+ **Header** which is consistent across the Home, Community and Gallery pages
+ **Navigation** to all three pages; Home, Community and Gallery
+ **Footer** which is consistent across all three pages with address of the market and links to social media accounts 
+ **home page** that includes the details of the market 
+ **Community page** with includes substainability tips and market rules 
+ **form** for visitors to join the comminity 
+ **fancybox gallery** to showcase vendors along with a caption of each vendors name to go with the photo

#### Structure
This is a simple three page website that will give users all the necessary information they will need to attend the farmers market or to sign up to find out further information. Users are presented with the most important information on the Home page, when and where the market is on and from there they can easily navigate to the Community and Gallery pages to gain further information about the market. 

Text is broken up with graphics to make the content easily digestable by reader. Each page carries the same look and feel to provide recognition to the user. 

#### Skeleton
Wireframes
1. [Home Page](docs/readme_images/homepage_wireframe.png)
2. [Sign Up Page](docs/readme_images/sign_up.png)
3. [Gallery Page](docs/readme_images/gallery_wireframe.png)

The site layout and content has changed since my initial wireframe however I have kept the simple three page layout. I simplified the design which ment I could achieve responsiveness easier. I kept the content short and sweet to keep the user engaged and to provide a MVP site that can be the basis to suit the markets infancy and which can be developed as the market devolps to provide more functionality to the user and business owener. 


#### Surface

The colour pallette was choosen as a nod to those colors that we so often find in the Irish landscape where our growers and producers live and work. Green was chosen for the header and footer as it is the color we associate with land. The blue and yellow accented throughout represent the sky and sun and the orange is a nod to the earth. All things that are needed for something to grow. The soft colors allow for an easy visual experience for the user and carry accross all pages to allow for familiarity for the user. Whitesmoke was chose as the text in the header, footer and form. Navy was chosen for the main body as I like that it is softer that traditional black and has a high accessiblity score agains the other colors used across the site. 

![Color chart](docs/readme_images/color_chart.png)

The font Ralway and Cabin was used as they are lightweight and have more a natural feel to them which I tought comlimented the colors. 

The use of graphics throughout the Home and Community page was used to compliement the colors and to keep the site clean and user friendly and to break up blocks of text to allow the user to take in the information in chunks. 


## Features 

### Current Features 

This is a fully responsive site that was created mobile first. The site is broken up into three pages. 

#### Header
The header is consistent across all three pages. The header contains the name, Kilworth Farmers' Market and the navigation for the site. The navigation and the logo are all centered in the header to allow the user to easily navigate the site from the header. 

![Header of site which includes the navigation links](docs/readme_images/header.png)

#### Navigation 
The navigation is in the center of the page and and consists of three links to the Home, Community and Gallery pages. The navigation links turn orange when hovered over and the current page will be underlined in white to let the user know what page they are currently on. 

#### Footer
The footer is consistent across all three pages at the bottom of the page and the color is consistent with the header to create a balanced page. The footer contains the address of the market along with the social media links to social platforms to allow the user to look at more online content linked too the market. 
![Footer of site which includes location and navigation links](docs/readme_images/footer.PNG)

#### Home Page
The home page is made up of a hero graphic along with two doodle graphics that I placed on colored backgrounds that tie in with the color scheme to break up the text. I kept the text to a minimum so as not to overwhelm the user but let them know everything they would need in order to learn about the market and know when and where it would be held.

#### Community Page
The community page follows a similar layout to the home page with minimal copy divided by graphics which use the site colors. There is two main sections here, substainability tips and market rules.

#### Gallery Page
The Gallery page showcases som of the vendors that will be attending the market along with a caption of their names for let site visitors know what they can expect to see at the market. 

The gallery was created using fancybox to allow site visitors to easily browse through the vendors.

## Future Features

#### Vendor Page
I would like to create a page dedicated to vendors so that we can highlight their business and link page to their own website.

#### Burger Menu
I would like to add a burger menu to the navigation link for smaller devices.

#### Testimonials 
I would like to add testimonials to give the user a sense of impact the market makes to the community

## Credits

- #### Copy
All copy was written by the developer after researching other farmer market websites.

- #### Design
Design was inspired from researching the following sites:
- [Junction Farmers Market](https://junctionmarket.ca/)
- [Cabbage Town Farmers Market](https://www.cabbagetownmarket.ca/)

- #### Media
Images were taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/collections/agriculture-84ityxd/), [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/farm) and [Ireland's Content Pool](https://www.irelandscontentpool.com/en/_/login?login.redirectlogin=/en) I resized all media with photoshop and paint. 

- #### Graphics
The hero graphic on the main page was downloaded from [here](https://pngset.com/download-free-png-eouky) I used photoshop to alter the graphic color to the navy that I used for the font color. The rest of the graphics were found on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and edited directly on the site.

- #### Use of CSS Grid
After researching options of how to build my website I opted to go with a grid layout. I used [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and Youtube, most notably [Kevin Powells channel](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob), to get a handle of how I should used grids to create a responsive website.

- #### Gallery layout 
I practiced many ways to layout a grid but [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHPudSzPYVg) really made it all click and work for my layout. 

- #### Fancybox Carousel
My mentor Guido Cecilio suggested fancybox for my gallery to improve used experience. He provided me with the code I needed to get started and I reseached the rest on platforms that I had previously used. 

All captions on the gallery are neighbors and friends names and businesses and I have permission to use them for this project. 

- #### Footer
The footer code is heavily inspired by the Love Running Project that was completed prior to starting the project. 

- #### Slack
Code Institute's slack channel was a huge help in helping with problems and to give a sense of what was expected for projects. Support from fellow students was greatly appreciated.

- #### Mentor
My mentor Guido Cecilio was extremely generous with his time and sharing helpful tips with me throughout out mentor sessions. It really helped to know I was on the right track and to have his expertise to learn from. 

- #### Cohort Facilitators
Code Institutes Facilitators were great throughout the project, answering questiosn and encouraging us to the finish line. They also made it easy to stay on track and keep everyone up to date. Thanks Kenan Wright and Kascia Bogucka.

- #### Code Institute and MSLETB
Big thank you to Code institute for creating such a great learning platform that gave me the tools and knowledge to create this website and for MSLETB for the opportunity to participate in this course.
