## UX 
#### Strategy

This site will be used to increase awareness of a new farmers' market to the broader locality and visitors to the area to help boost the local economy and local suppliers and vendors.

Target Users:

1. Those living or visiting the locality of Kilworth
2. Vendors and producers who are living in the community or within driving distance
4. People who wish to support the local economy
5. People who are interested in contributing to making the locality more substainable

What the users are looking for:

1. Information about when and where the farmers market is on
2. To be able find out more information by signing up to join the community
3. To be able to see what vendors will be in attendance

#### Scope
In order to achieve the strategy for both business and user goals I have included the following features:

1. **Header** which is consistent across the Home, Community and Gallery pages
2. **Navigation** to all three pages; Home, Community and Gallery
3. **Footer** which is consistent across all three pages with address of the market and links to social media accounts 
4. A **home page** that includes the details of the market 
5. **Community page** with includes substainability tips and market rules 
6. A **form** for visitors to join the comminity 
7. A **fancybox gallery** to showcase vendors along with a caption of each vendors name to go with the photo

#### Structure
This is a simple three page website that will give users all the necessary information they will need to attend the farmers market or to sign up to find out further information. Users are presented with the most important information on the Home page, when and where the market is on and from there they can easily navigate to the Community and Gallery pages to gain further information about the market. 

Text is broken up with graphics to make the content easily digestable by reader. Each page carries the same look and feel to provide recognition to the user. 

#### Skeleton
Wireframes
1. [Home Page](docs/readme_images/homepage_wireframe.png)
2. [Sign Up Page](docs/readme_images/sign_up.png)
3. [Gallery Page](docs/readme_images/gallery_wireframe.png)

The site layout and content has changed since my initial wireframe however I have kept the simple three page layout. I simplified the design which ment I could achieve responsiveness easier. I kept the content short and sweet to keep the user engaged and to provide a MVP site that can be the basis to suit the markets infancy and which can be developed as the market devolps to provide more functionality to the user and business owener. 


#### Surface

The colour pallette was choosen as a nod to those colors that we so often find in the Irish landscape where out growers and producers live and work. Green was chosen for the header and footer as it is the color we associate with land. The blue and yellow accented throughout represent the sky and sun and the orange is a nod to the earth. All thiings that are needed for something to grow. The soft colors allow for an easy visual experience for the user and carry accross all pages to allow for familiarity for the user.

The font Ralway and Cabin was used as they are lightweight and have more a natural feel to them which I tought comlimented the colors. 

The use of graphics throughout the Home and Community page was used to compliement the colors and to keep the site clean and user friendly and to break up blocks of text to allow the user to take in the information in chunks. 


## Features 

### Current Features 

This is a fully responsive site that was created mobile first. The site is broken up into three pages. 

#### Header
The header is consistent across all three pages. The header contains the name, Kilworth Farmers' Market and the navigation for the site. The navigation and the logo are all centered in the header to allow the user to easily navigate the site from the header.

#### Navigation 
The navigation is in the center of the page and and consists of three links to the Home, Community and Gallery pages. The navigation links turn orange when hovered over and the current page will be underlined in white to let the user know what page they are currently on. 

#### Footer
The footer is consistent across all three pages at the bottom of the page and the color is consistent with the header to create a balanced page. The footer contains the address of the market along with the social media links to social platforms to allow the user to look at more online content linked too the market.

#### Home Page
The home page is made up of a hero graphic along with two doodle graphics that I placed on colored backgrounds that tie in with the color scheme to break up the text. I kept the text to a minimum so as not to overwhelm the user but let them know everything they would need in order to learn about the market and know when and where it would be held.

#### Community Page
The community page follows a similar layout to the home page with minimal copy divided by graphics which use the site colors. There is two main sections here, substainability tips and market rules.

The Gallery page showcases som of the vendors that will be attending the market along with a caption of their names for let site visitors know what they can expect to see at the market.
