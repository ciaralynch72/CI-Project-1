        <h2>
            Locally sourced, locally ran and locally supported. A community market for all.
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            The market was conceived after global events of the last few years and how they affected our community as a whloe and as individuals.
            Our abilty to connect with others, our abilty to puchase daily neccesities and our abilty to choose where and when we went places was taken away. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Although our way of lives changed , it did give us time to think about what is truly important too us all. We took up gardening, baking and knitting. We crafted,
            we became DIY enthusisits but most of all we found solace in the everyday tasks that were common place in our community only a generation ago. These tasks made
            us far more self sufficient than we every knew we could be. We made what we needed and we shared what we had. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            This market is for all of us to share what we created, purchase what we need and engage with family and friends and come to gether to support all our wonderful 
            local suppliers.
